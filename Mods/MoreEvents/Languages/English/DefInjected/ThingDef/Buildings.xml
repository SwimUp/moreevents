  <ColdFusionReactor.label>Cold fusion reactor</ColdFusionReactor.label>
  <ColdFusionReactor.description>A reactor operating in uranium, but based on the principle of cold fusion. Almost does not emit heat, but it is a good source of energy.</ColdFusionReactor.description>
  <ColdFusionReactorHeath.label>Cold fusion reactor heart</ColdFusionReactorHeath.label>
  <ColdFusionReactorHeath.description>The main part of the cold fusion reactor. With the help of it, it will be possible to modernize a nuclear reactor in order to obtain a new, more perfect source of energy.</ColdFusionReactorHeath.description>
  <MiniColdFusionReactor.label>Minified cold fusion reactor</MiniColdFusionReactor.label>
  <MiniColdFusionReactor.description>Reduced cold fusion reactor. Still effective, but takes up much less space, so it can be used in a wider range of objects.</MiniColdFusionReactor.description>
  <MiniArcReactor.label>Minified arc reactor</MiniArcReactor.label>
  <MiniArcReactor.description>Reduced arc reactor. More effective than a cold fusion reactor, is its direct modification.</MiniArcReactor.description>
