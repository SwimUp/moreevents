	<ClimateBombDesc>We've discovered the location of an armed climate bomb. Who built it and why it was left on this planet is not clear, but we need to neutralize it. If we don't and allow it to detonate, the next few seasons will be very chaotic. \n\nWe need to assemble a strong combat force, there will likely be enemies defending it.

	<Comm_ShipCrashTitle>Ship crash</Comm_ShipCrashTitle>
	<Comm_ShipCrashDesc>A space ship was spotted breaking apart in atmosphere. It appears to be general purpose traveler's ship. Segments of the ship separate and diverge onto their own crash courses, likely cargo and living compartments of various sizes. \nThe ship's parts have scattered all over the planet. Ship plating is often constructed with plasteel and may have left some of the contents intact. You can travel to the crash sites and attempt to salvage what you can, but many others will have also seen the crash and will surely want to claim some of it for themselves.</Comm_ShipCrashDesc>
